# Disk_Simulations
A fortran program to create artificial fits images of a exponentional disk.


This is the IDL/GDL version.

Current Status:

There are two codes here one with the extension ad
the ad extended one does not run correctly.
Because it doesn't find the rotation curve
The version without ad has a stop build into it at line 226, unclear why.
The version with ad runs once the correct file names are provided.
It runs but it is far too slow to be of any use at the moment. Aborting the run.
